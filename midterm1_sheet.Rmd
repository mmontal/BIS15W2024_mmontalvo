## Types of Data
There are five frequently used `classes` of data: 1. numeric, 2. integer, 3. character, 4. logical, 5. complex.
```{r}
my_numeric <- 42
my_integer <- 2L #adding an L automatically denotes an integer
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE
my_complex <- 2+4i
```

To find out what type of data you are working with, use the `class()` function. This is important because sometimes we will need to change the type of data to perform certain analyses.
```{r}
class(my_numeric)
class(my_integer)
```

You can use the `is()` and `as()` functions to clarify or specify a type of data.
```{r}
is.integer(my_numeric) #is my_numeric an integer?
```

```{r}
my_integer <- 
  as.integer(my_numeric) #create a new object specified as an integer
```

NA values are used to designate missing data. `is.na` or `anyNA` are useful functions when dealing with NAs in data. 
```{r}
my_missing <- NA
```

```{r}
is.na(my_missing)
```

```{r}
anyNA(my_missing)
```

## Vectors
Vectors are a common way of organizing data in R.  We create vectors using the `c` command. The `c` stands for concatenate.  

A numeric vector.
```{r}
my_vector <- c(10, 20, 30)
```

A character vector. Characters always have quotes and may be referred to as "strings".
```{r}
days_of_the_week <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thrusday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
```

## Data Matrices
Data matrices are a series of stacked vectors, similar to a data table. In the example below, we build a new data matrix using the matrix command.  

Box office earnings for Harry Potter movies (in millions!). Notice that these are separate vectors.  
```{r}
Philosophers_Stone <- c(317.5, 657.1)
Chamber_of_Secrets <- c(261.9, 616.9)
Prisoner_of_Azkaban <- c(249.5, 547.1)
Goblet_of_Fire <- c(290.0, 606.8)
Order_of_the_Phoenix <- c(292.0, 647.8)
Half_Blood_Prince <- c(301.9, 632.4)
Deathly_Hallows_1 <- c(295.9, 664.3)
Deathly_Hallows_2 <- c(381.0, 960.5)
```

Create a new object called `box_office`. Here we are using the `c` command to combine the vectors into one.
```{r}
box_office <- c(Philosophers_Stone, Chamber_of_Secrets, Prisoner_of_Azkaban, Goblet_of_Fire, Order_of_the_Phoenix, Half_Blood_Prince, Deathly_Hallows_1, Deathly_Hallows_2)
box_office
```

Create `harry_potter_matrix` using the `matrix()` command. We need to tell R how to organize the `box_office` vector using the `nrow` and `byrow` commands.
```{r}
harry_potter_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 8, byrow = T)
harry_potter_matrix
```
## Name the rows and columns
Vectors `region` and `titles`, used for naming.
```{r}
region <- c("US", "non-US")
region
```

```{r}
titles <- c("Philosophers_Stone", "Chamber_of_Secrets", "Prisoner_of_Azkaban", "Goblet_of_Fire", "Order_of_the_Phoenix", "Half_Blood_Prince", "Deathly_Hallows_1", "Deathly_Hallows_2")
titles
```

Name the columns using `colnames()` with the vector region.
```{r}
colnames(harry_potter_matrix) <- region
```

Name the rows using `rownames()` with the vector titles.
```{r}
rownames(harry_potter_matrix) <- titles
```

Print `harry_potter_matrix`.
```{r}
harry_potter_matrix
```

## Using a data matrix
Once you have a data matrix, you can perform lots of different analyses. For example, you can calculate the total earnings of each movie.
```{r}
global <- rowSums(harry_potter_matrix)
global
```

And even add a new column to reflect this calculation. `cbind()` adds columns.
```{r}
all_harry_potter_matrix <- cbind(harry_potter_matrix, global)
all_harry_potter_matrix
```

## Practice
1. What are the total earnings for the US and non-US regions?  

```{r}
total_earnings <- colSums(all_harry_potter_matrix)
total_earnings
```

2. Add this information to the data matrix. Hint: you are adding a row, not a column.  
```{r}
rbind(all_harry_potter_matrix, total_earnings)
```


## A few Extras
The same methods of selecting elements in a vector apply to data matrices. We use `[]`. The following selects the value in the first column, second row.
```{r}
harry_potter_matrix[2,1]
```

Adding a colon `:` selects the specified elements in a column.  
```{r}
harry_potter_matrix[1:4]
```

We can also select values in an entire row or column. This can be useful for calculations. Here we calculate the mean of the entire second column. 
```{r}
non_us_earnings <- all_harry_potter_matrix[ ,2]
mean(non_us_earnings)
```

## LAB 3

## Data Frames
During lab 2, you learned how to work with vectors and data matrices. Today we will organize the vectors into a new type of data structure called a **data frame**. The data frame is the most common way to organize data within R. You can think of a data frame as similar to a spreadsheet. A data frame can store data of many different classes.  

Let's build separate vectors that include length (in), weight (oz), and sex of three [ruby-throated hummingbirds](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/ruby-throated-hummingbird).  
```{r}
Sex <- c("male", "female", "male")
Length <- c(3.2, 3.7, 3.4)
Weight <- c(2.9, 4.0, 3.1)
```

Here we combine our three vectors to create a data frame with the function `data.frame()`.
```{r}
hbirds <- data.frame(Sex, Length, Weight)
hbirds
```

OK, stop and think- how does this differ from making a data matrix? Are the data treated differently?  
```{r}
hummingbirds <- c(Sex, Length, Weight)
hummingbirds_matrix <- matrix(hummingbirds, ncol=3, byrow = F)
hummingbirds_matrix
```

```{r}
fish <- readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

## Tidyverse
The [tidyverse](www.tidyverse.org) is an "opinionated" collection of packages that make workflow in R easier. The packages operate more intuitively than base R commands and share a common organizational philosophy.  
![*Data Science Workflow in the Tidyverse.*](tidy-1.png)  

## dplyr
The first package that we will use that is part of the tidyverse is `dplyr`. `dplyr` is used to transform data frames by extracting, rearranging, and summarizing data such that they are focused on a question of interest. This is very helpful,  especially when wrangling large data, and makes dplyr one of most frequently used packages in the tidyverse. The two functions we will use most are `select()` and `filter()`.  

## `select()`
Select allows you to pull out columns of interest from a dataframe. To do this, just add the names of the columns to the `select()` command. The order in which you add them, will determine the order in which they appear in the output.
```{r}
names(fish)
```

We are only interested in lakeid and scalelength.
```{r}
select(fish, "lakeid", "scalelength")
```

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
fish_subset <- select(fish, "fish_id", "length")
```

To add a range of columns use `start_col:end_col`.
```{r}
select(fish, fish_id:length)
```

The - operator is useful in select. It allows us to select everything except the specified variables.
```{r}
select(fish, -"fish_id", -"annnumber", -"length", -"radii_length_mm")
```

For very large data frames with lots of variables, `select()` utilizes lots of different operators to make things easier. Let's say we are only interested in the variables that deal with length.

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("length"))
```

When columns are sequentially named, `starts_with()` makes selecting columns easier.
```{r}
select(fish, starts_with("radii"))
```

Options to select columns based on a specific criteria include:  
1. ends_with() = Select columns that end with a character string  
2. contains() = Select columns that contain a character string  
3. matches() = Select columns that match a regular expression  
4. one_of() = Select columns names that are from a group of names  

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, ends_with("id"))
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("fish"))
```

We won't cover regular expressions [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in this class, but the following code is helpful when you know that a column contains a letter (in this case "a") followed by a subsequent string (in this case "er").  
```{r}
select(fish, matches("a.+er")) #handy bit of code for the project
```

You can also select columns based on the class of data.  
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```

```{r}
select_if(fish, is.numeric)
```

To select all columns that are *not* a class of data, you need to add a `~`.
```{r}
select_if(fish, ~!is.numeric(.)) ## the exclamation point means not, period means look in all cells. 
```

## Practice  
For this exercise we will use life history data `mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv` for mammals. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from:  
**S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.**  

Load the data.  

```{r}
```

```{r}
read_csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv")
```

1. Use one or more of your favorite functions to assess the structure of the data.  
```{r}
mammals <- read_csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv")
glimpse(mammals)
```

2. Are there any NAs? Are you sure? Try taking an average of `max. life` as a test.  
```{r}
mean(mammals$`max. life`)
```

```{r}
anyNA(mammals)
```

```{r}
summary(mammals)
```

3. What are the names of the columns in the `mammals` data?
```{r}
names(mammals)
```

4. Rename any columns that have capitol letters or punctuation issues.  
```{r}
mammalas_new <- rename (mammals, genus= "Genus", wean_mass="wean mass", max_life="max. life", litter_size="litter size", litter_per_year="litters/year")
```

5. We are only interested in the variables `genus`, `species`, and `mass`. Use `select()` to build a new dataframe `mass` focused on these variables.
```{r}
mass <- select(mammalas_new, genus:mass)
```

```{r}

```

6. What if we only wanted to exclude `order` and `family`? Use the `-` operator to make the code efficient.
```{r}
select(mammalas_new, -order, -family)
```

7. Select the columns that include "mass" as part of the name.  
```{r}
select(mammalas_new, contains("mass"))
```

8. Select all of the columns that are of class `character`.  
```{r}
select_if(mammalas_new, ~!is.numeric(.)) 
```

```{r}
select_if(mammalas_new, is.character)
```

## Other
Here are two examples of code that are super helpful to have in your bag of tricks.  

Imported data frames often have a mix of lower and uppercase column names. Use `toupper()` or `tolower()` to fix this issue. I always try to use lowercase to keep things consistent.  
```{r}
select_all(mammals, tolower)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
names(mammals)
```
```{r}
clean_names(mammals)
```

When naming columns, blank spaces are often added (don't do this, please). Here is a trick to remove these.  
```{r}
select_all(mammals, ~str_replace(., " ", "_"))
```

## Filter rules
Rules:  
+ `filter(condition1, condition2)` will return rows where both conditions are met.  
+ `filter(condition1, !condition2)` will return all rows where condition one is true but condition 2 is not.  
+ `filter(condition1 | condition2)` will return rows where condition 1 or condition 2 is met.  
+ `filter(xor(condition1, condition2)` will return all rows where only one of the conditions is met, and not when both conditions are met. 

## Using `filter()` on multiple conditions
You can also use `filter()` to extract data based on multiple conditions. Below we extract only the fish that have lakeid "AL" and length >350.
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "AL" & length > 350)
```

Notice that the `|` operator generates a different result.
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "AL" | length > 350)
```

## LAB 5

## Pipes `%>%` 
In order to start combining `select()`, `filter()`, and other functions efficiently, we need to learn pipes. Pipes feed the output from one function into the input of another function. This helps us keep our code sequential and clean.

## `arrange()`
The `arrange()` command is a bit like a sort command in excel. Note that the default is ascending order.  

## `mutate()`  
Mutate allows us to create a new column from existing columns in a data frame. We are doing a small introduction here and will add some additional functions later. Let's convert the length variable from cm to millimeters and create a new variable called length_mm.  
```{r}
fish %>% 
  mutate(length_mm = length*10) %>% 
  select(fish_id, length, length_mm)
```

## `mutate_all()`
This last function is super helpful when cleaning data. With "wild" data, there are often mixed entries (upper and lowercase), blank spaces, odd characters, etc. These all need to be dealt with before analysis.  

Here is an example that changes all entries to lowercase (if present).  
```{r}
mammals %>%
  mutate_all(tolower)
```

Using the across function we can specify individual columns.
```{r}
mammals %>% 
  mutate(across(c("order", "family"), tolower))
```

## `if_else()`
We will briefly introduce `if_else()` here because it allows us to use `mutate()` but not have the entire column affected in the same way. In a sense, this can function like find and replace in a spreadsheet program. With `ifelse()`, you first specify a logical statement, afterwards what needs to happen if the statement returns `TRUE`, and lastly what needs to happen if it's  `FALSE`.  

Have a look at the data from mammals below. Notice that the values for newborn include `-999.00`. This is sometimes used as a placeholder for NA (but, is a really bad idea). We can use `if_else()` to replace `-999.00` with `NA`.  
```{r}
mammals %>% 
  select(genus, species, newborn) %>% 
  arrange(newborn)
```

```{r}
mammals %>% 
  select(genus, species, newborn) %>%
  mutate(newborn_new = ifelse(newborn == -999.00, NA, newborn))%>% 
  arrange(newborn)
```

## LAB 6

## Data tidy
1. Some of the names used in the `superhero_info` data are problematic so you should rename them here. Before you do anything, first have a look at the names of the variables. You can use `rename()` or `clean_names()`.    
```{r}
superhero_info <- clean_names(superhero_info)
```


## `tabyl`
The `janitor` package has many awesome functions that we will explore. Here is its version of `table` which not only produces counts but also percentages. Very handy! Let's use it to explore the proportion of good guys and bad guys in the `superhero_info` data.  
```{r}
tabyl(superhero_info, alignment)
```

## LAB 7
Histograms are also a quick way to check the output.
```{r}
hist(msleep24$sleep_total_24)
```

## `summarize()`
`summarize()` will produce summary statistics for a given variable in a data frame. For example, if you are asked to calculate the mean of `sleep_total` for large and small mammals you could do this using a combination of commands, but it isn't very efficient or clean. We can do better!  
```{r}
head(msleep)
```

For example, if we define "large" as having a `bodywt` greater than 200 then we get the following:
```{r}
large <- msleep %>% 
  select(name, genus, bodywt, sleep_total) %>% 
  filter(bodywt > 200) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bodywt))
large
```

```{r}
mean(large$sleep_total)
```

We can accomplish the same task using the `summarize()` function to make things cleaner.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt>200) %>% 
  summarize(mean_sleep_lg=mean(sleep_total))
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt<10) %>% 
  summarize(mean_sleep_sm=mean(sleep_total))
```

You can also combine functions to make useful summaries for multiple variables.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt>200) %>% 
  summarize(mean_sleep_lg=mean(sleep_total), 
            min_sleep_lg=min(sleep_total), 
            max_sleep_lg=max(sleep_total),
            sd_sleep_lg=sd(sleep_total),
            total=n())
```

## Practice
1. What is the mean, min, and max `bodywt` for the taxonomic order Primates? Provide the total number of observations.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(order=="Primates") %>% 
  summarize(mean_bodywt=mean(bodywt), 
            min_bodywt=min(bodywt), 
            max_bodywt=max(bodywt),
            sd_bodywt=sd(bodywt),
            total=n())
```

`n_distinct()` is a very handy way of cleanly presenting the number of distinct observations. Here we show the number of distinct genera over 100 in body weight.  

Notice that there are multiple genera with over 100 in body weight.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt > 100)
```

n_distinct() is a very handy way of cleanly presenting the number of distinct observations. Here we show the number of distinct genera over 100 in body weight.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  summarize(n_genera=n_distinct(genus)) #this is going to count the number of genera in msleep.
```

```{r}
glimpse(msleep)
```

There are many other useful summary statistics, depending on your needs: sd(), min(), max(), median(), sum(), n() (returns the length of a column), first() (returns first value in a column), last() (returns last value in a column) and n_distinct() (number of distinct values in a column).

## Counts
Although these summary functions are super helpful, oftentimes we are mostly interested in counts. The [janitor package](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html) does a lot with counts, but there are also functions that are part of dplyr that are useful.  

`count()` is an easy way of determining how many observations you have within a column. It acts like a combination of `group_by()` and `n()`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island, sort = T) #sort=T sorts the column in descending order
```

Compare this with `summarize()` and `group_by()`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarize(n=n())
```

You can also use `count()` across multiple variables.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island, species, sort = T) # sort=T will arrange in descending order
```

For counts, I also like `tabyl()`. Lots of options are supported in [tabyl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html)
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(island, species)
```

## Practice
1. How does the mean of `bill_length_mm` compare between penguin species?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(bill_length_mm, species)
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  count(bill_length_mm)
```


2. For some penguins, their sex is listed as NA. Where do these penguins occur?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(sex) %>% 
  summarize(number_NAs=sum(is.na(sex)))
```

## `across()`
What about using `filter()` and `select()` across multiple variables? There is a function in dplyr called `across()` which is designed to work across multiple variables. Have a look at Rebecca Barter's awesome blog [here](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-07-09-across/).    

What if we wanted to apply `summarize()` in order to produce distinct counts over multiple variables; i.e. species, island, and sex? Although this isn't a lot of coding you can image that with a lot of variables it would be cumbersome.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(distinct_species = n_distinct(species),
            distinct_island = n_distinct(island),
            distinct_sex = n_distinct(sex))
```

By using `across()` we can reduce the clutter and make things cleaner. 
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(c(species, island, sex), n_distinct))
```

This is very helpful for continuous variables.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))) #use this to correct the error.
```

`group_by` also works.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

Here we summarize across all variables.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm=T)
```

Operators can also work, here I am summarizing across all variables except `species`, `island`, `sex`, and `year`.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(!c(species, island, sex, year), 
                   mean, na.rm=T))
```

All variables that include "bill"...all of the other dplyr operators also work.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(starts_with("bill"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

```{r}
#fisheries_tidy %>% distinct(country)
#unique(fisheries_tidy$country)
```
