## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
setwd("~/Desktop/BIS15W2024_mmontalvo/lab11")
deserts <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?

```r
summary(deserts)
```

```

## 
```

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?

```r
deserts %>% 
  summarize(n_distinct(genus),
            n_distinct(species), 
            total_n= n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 3
##   `n_distinct(genus)` `n_distinct(species)` total_n
##                 <int>                 <int>   <int>
## 1                  26                    40   34786
```

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.

```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(taxa))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title="Individuals by Taxa", 
       x= "Taxa", 
       y= "Count")+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`

```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(taxa, fill=plot_type))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title="Individuals by Taxa", 
       x= "Taxa", 
       y= "Count")+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.

```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y= species, group=species, na.rm=T))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2503 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.

```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y= species, group=species, na.rm=T))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2503 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2503 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?

```r
deserts %>%
  filter(species=="merriami") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_jitter(na.rm=T, size=.2)
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.

```r
deserts %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight=mean(weight, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      mean_weight
##    <chr>              <dbl>
##  1 albigula           159. 
##  2 spectabilis        120. 
##  3 spilosoma           93.5
##  4 hispidus            65.6
##  5 fulviventer         58.9
##  6 ochrognathus        55.4
##  7 ordii               48.9
##  8 merriami            43.2
##  9 baileyi             31.7
## 10 leucogaster         31.6
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(species=="albigula"| species=="spectabilis") %>% 
  mutate(w_h_ratio=weight/hindfoot_length) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=w_h_ratio, fill=sex))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.

```r
deserts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex, y=weight)) + 
  geom_col()+
  labs(title="Weight by Sex",
       x="Sex", 
       y="Weight")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))
```

```
## Warning: Removed 2503 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).
```
