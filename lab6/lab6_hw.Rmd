## Learning Goals  
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Develop your dplyr superpowers so you can easily and confidently manipulate dataframes.  
2. Learn helpful new functions that are part of the `janitor` package.  

## Instructions
For the second part of lab today, we are going to spend time practicing the dplyr functions we have learned and add a few new ones. This lab doubles as your homework. Please complete the lab and push your final code to GitHub.  

## Load the libraries
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```

## Load the superhero data
These are data taken from comic books and assembled by fans. The include a good mix of categorical and continuous data.  Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set  

Check out the way I am loading these data. If I know there are NAs, I can take care of them at the beginning. But, we should do this very cautiously. At times it is better to keep the original columns and data intact.  
```{r}
superhero_info <- read_csv("data/heroes_information.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-"))
superhero_powers <- read_csv("data/super_hero_powers.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-"))
```

## Data tidy
1. Some of the names used in the `superhero_info` data are problematic so you should rename them here. Before you do anything, first have a look at the names of the variables. You can use `rename()` or `clean_names()`.    
```{r}
superhero_info <- clean_names(superhero_info)
```


## `tabyl`
The `janitor` package has many awesome functions that we will explore. Here is its version of `table` which not only produces counts but also percentages. Very handy! Let's use it to explore the proportion of good guys and bad guys in the `superhero_info` data.  
```{r}
tabyl(superhero_info, alignment)
```

1. Who are the publishers of the superheros? Show the proportion of superheros from each publisher. Which publisher has the highest number of superheros?  
```{r}
tabyl(superhero_info, publisher)
```

2. Notice that we have some neutral superheros! Who are they? List their names below.  
```{r}
superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, alignment) %>% 
  filter(alignment=="neutral")
```

## `superhero_info`
3. Let's say we are only interested in the variables name, alignment, and "race". How would you isolate these variables from `superhero_info`?
```{r}
superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, alignment, race)
```

## Not Human
4. List all of the superheros that are not human.
```{r}
superhero_info <- superhero_info %>% 
  mutate_all(tolower)
```
```{r}
not_human <- superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, race) %>% 
  filter(race!= "human")
not_human
```

## Good and Evil
5. Let's make two different data frames, one focused on the "good guys" and another focused on the "bad guys".
```{r}
good_guys <- superhero_info %>% 
  filter(alignment=="good")
good_guys
```

```{r}
bad_guys <- superhero_info %>% 
  filter(alignment=="bad")
bad_guys
```

6. For the good guys, use the `tabyl` function to summarize their "race".
```{r}
tabyl(good_guys, race)
```

7. Among the good guys, Who are the Vampires?
```{r}
good_guys %>% 
  filter(race=="vampire")
```

8. Among the bad guys, who are the male humans over 200 inches in height?
```{r}
bad_guys %>% 
  select(name, gender, height, race) %>% 
  filter(gender=="male", height>200, race=="human")
```

9. Are there more good guys or bad guys with green hair?  
```{r}
good_guys %>% 
  select(name, hair_color) %>% 
  filter(hair_color=="green")
```

```{r}
bad_guys %>% 
  select(name, hair_color) %>% 
  filter(hair_color=="green")
```
### There are more good guys with green hair. 

```{r}
glimpse(superhero_info)
```

10. Let's explore who the really small superheros are. In the `superhero_info` data, which have a weight less than 50? Be sure to sort your results by weight lowest to highest. 
```{r}
small_superheros <- superhero_info %>% 
  mutate(weight_new= as.numeric(weight)) %>% 
  select(name, weight_new) %>% 
  filter(weight_new<50) %>% 
  arrange(weight_new)
small_superheros
```

11. Let's make a new variable that is the ratio of height to weight. Call this variable `height_weight_ratio`.
```{r}
superhero_info %>%
  mutate(weight_new= as.numeric(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(height_new= as.numeric(height)) %>% 
  mutate(height_weight_ratio= height_new/weight_new) %>% select(name, height_new, weight_new, height_weight_ratio)
```

12. Who has the highest height to weight ratio?  
```{r}
superhero_info %>%
  mutate(weight_new= as.numeric(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(height_new= as.numeric(height)) %>% 
  mutate(height_weight_ratio= height_new/weight_new) %>% select(name, height_new, weight_new, height_weight_ratio) %>% 
  arrange(desc(height_weight_ratio))
```
### Groot

## `superhero_powers`
Have a quick look at the `superhero_powers` data frame. 
```{r}
glimpse(superhero_powers)
```

13. How many superheros have a combination of agility, stealth, super_strength, stamina?
```{r}
superhero_powers <- clean_names(superhero_powers)
```

```{r}
superhero_powers %>% 
  select(hero_names, agility, stealth, super_strength, stamina) %>% filter(agility=="TRUE", stealth=="TRUE", super_strength=="TRUE", stamina=="TRUE")
```

## Your Favorite
14. Pick your favorite superhero and let's see their powers!
```{r}
superhero_powers %>% 
  filter(hero_names=="Spider-Man")
```

15. Can you find your hero in the superhero_info data? Show their info!  
```{r}
superhero_info %>% 
  filter(name=="spider-man")
```
